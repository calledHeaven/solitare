# solitare
a repository dedicated to the personal project of creating a game of solitaire in C#, starting with basic console text, working towards a graphical executable

## overview
this repository will document the creation of a program that will run solitare, originaly text based, working towards askii representation, eventualy graphical representation. this document will thus be split into three sections, being created and adjusted as the project continues. the first section follows

### text based solitare
the main aim of this section is to create a basic solitare program that will be the basis of all the future itterations. the main aim is to create a deck of cards that can be used to deal a hand of klondike solitare, and can accept the rules, creating a playable game. this may be dificult, as the visual representatin is key to a game, however it may overcomplicate the project at the current moment. in order to do this I intend to use an object oriented program in the console.
